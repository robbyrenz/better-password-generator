# Random Password Generator
A Python program that randomly generates a password, in which its length is specified by the user. The passwords can consist of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers and punctuation. I consider this program as an improvement over my previous program (also written in Python) because it uses more Pythonic code :)
